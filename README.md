# Focus_set_semantic_difference
This repository contains the focus set semantic difference generator described in my doctoral thesis: "Focus Set Subontologies and Semantic Difference for Large ELH Ontologies"

* To compute the semantic difference between focus set subontologies:

java -jar ELH_UI_DIFF_PCK_7-3_NDR.jar <ontology_path_1/O_1.owl> <ontology_path_2/O_2.owl> <output_folder_path>


The jar file: ELH_UI_DIFF_PCK_7-3_NDR.jar is based on the ELH forgetter developed by [gdhzLZ](https://github.com/gdhzLZ/ELH-forgetting).

All the data for the experiments described in Section 5.5 of my thesis is [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y1WCpXCI0BvlHnGFQxHZO9qywbFb-i23?usp=sharing).
